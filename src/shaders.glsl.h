    Overview:

            Get shader desc: pbr_display_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());

            Fragment shader: display

        Shader program 'pbr_shader':
            Get shader desc: pbr_shader_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());

    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader pbr_display = sg_make_shader(pbr_display_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));
        sg_shader pbr_shader = sg_make_shader(pbr_shader_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_texcoord] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;
